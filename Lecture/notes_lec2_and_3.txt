Make a directory:

- Command is 'mkdir' followed by the name of the directory
- Command 'mkdir -p' followed by a path (eg: Class/Code) will first create the Class directory and the Code directory within it
- Absolute or relative paths can be used

Copying and Moving files:

- Commands are 'cp <source> <destination>' for copy and 'mv <source> <destination>' for move
- 'cp -R <source> <destination>' will copy a folder (with subdirectories) to the destination
- 'mv' can also be used to rename a file (eg: mv file_1.txt old_file_1.bak)
- Absolute or relative paths can be used
- Careful when copying and moving. There will be no warning if overwriting a file with the same name.

Removing a Directory:

- Command is 'rmdir <directory>'
- Must be empty

Changing a Directory:

- Command is 'cd'
- Followed by the absolute or relative path
- 'cd ..' will move up a directory
- 'cd ../..' will move up two directories, etc.

Environmental Variables:

- Stores information on the users environment
- HOME stores the location of the home directory
- PATH stores the location of installed programs
- To view the contents of the variable, use the 'echo' command
- 'echo $HOME' displays the information stored with the HOME variable
- The dollar sign denotes that HOME is a variable

Removing a File:

- Command is 'rm <PATH TO FILE>'
- Removing a file (or directory) will completely erase it. Use it with extreme caution.

Changing Permissions:

- Command is 'chmod <PERMISSIONS> <PATH TO FILE>'
- Permissions can be set for the user, group, and others
- For each, you have set read, write, and execute permissions
- These can be set with numbers: 4 = Read, 2 = Write, 1 = Execute
- If you add these numbers that sets that combination of permissions: 6, which is 4+2, is read and write
  eg: 'chmod 755 new_file.txt' means set the read, write, and execute permissions for the user (7), and the read and execute permissions for the group and others (5).
- 0 removes permmissions: eg: 'chmod 500 new_file.txt' sets the read and execute permissions for the user (5), and removes permissions for the group and others.
